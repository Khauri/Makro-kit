This project demonstrates using several polojs packages to create a Twitter clone.

The packages used are

- `@polojs/tanstack-query` - A port of `@tanstack/query` used to make async requests on the client
- `@polojs/swagger-inline-plugin` - A plugin to help generate an SDK and route validation from JSDOC comments.
